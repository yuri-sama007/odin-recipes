      <h2> Description</h2>

        <p>Harira is a zesty, fragrant tomato-based soup with chickpeas and lentils. Robustly seasoned with ginger, pepper, cinnamon and lots of fresh herbs, it’s especially popular in Ramadan when it’s served to break the fast.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
     <li>  6 cups beef stock</li>

     <li>  1 cup dry lentils</li>

     <li> 1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste</li>

     <li> 1 onion, chopped</li>

     <li> 1 cinnamon stick</li>

     <li>  1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root</li>

     <li>  1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>

     <li>  1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>

     <li>  1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

     <li>  1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained</li>

     <li>  1 (15 ounce) can red kidney beans, rinsed and drained</li>

     <li>  1 (14 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>

     <li>  1 cup cooked quinoa (Optional)</li>

     <li>  1 bunch flat-leaf parsley leaves and thinner stems, chopped</li>

     <li>   1 bunch cilantro leaves and thinner stems, chopped</li>

     <li>  1 lemon, or to taste, juiced</li>
 </ul>


   <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ul>

    <h4>Step 1:</h4>
       <li>Stir beef stock and lentils together in a large pot; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and keep at a simmer while preparing onion.</li>
    <h4>Step 2:</h4>
      <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, cinnamon stick, ginger, turmeric, cumin, and black pepper in the hot oil until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes; add to stock mixture.</li>
    <h4>Step 3:</h4>
      <li>Pour garbanzo beans, kidney beans, tomatoes, and quinoa into the stock mixture; stir and bring mixture to a boil. Stir parsley and cilantro into the stock mixture; reduce heat to low and cook mixture at a simmer until the lentils are tender, about 45 minutes. Drizzle lemon juice over the soup before serving. </li>
     </ul>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
      
    <h3>Cooks's Notes:</h3>
     
     <p>To make the soup wholly vegetarian, trade out the beef stock for vegetable stock.

        If you do use quinoa, be sure to prepare it separately from the soup (1/2 cup unprepared = 1 cup prepared). Throwing it into the soup unprepared will cause it to absorb all the liquid and you will be left with a very, very thick stew.</p>
